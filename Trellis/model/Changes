entities/SModelMember.cc, .h
	changed so that we can set the tag to correspond to the
	model tag given by Simmetrix model interface.  Used
	only for AOMD version 4 sms file as of 9/2/04.

*tagged as v2_0_2    3/12/2003  -li


* checkout from Attic and make it depends on nothing by:
  - clean attribute and mesh inverse classification stuff out of model
  - move the necessary utilities into model
* tagged as v2_0_1   09/06/2002  -li


--------------------------


version 1.2
-----------
* topoModel can now set it's bounding box size
* new data attachement routines
* mesh inverse classification redone, functions to get this now in
  SMesh class rather than GEntity classes
* SModelMember now stores entity tags, constructors for entities 
  must pass their tags
* added GEN_inClosure - determines if a model entity is on the closure of 
  another
* added GEN_reparam - reparametrize one entity w/r to another

version 1.1
-----------
* update for mesh 4.1

version 1.0
-----------
* mesh inverse classification added
* classes renamed (poor choice of original names)
  - GShellUse -> GShell
  - GEdgeUseSide -> GEdgeUse
  - GEdgeUse -> GEdgeUsePair
* in C interface: GEU_* -> GEUP_*
* fixed TopoModel to work with information retrieved in a smd file
* changes writeSMD so that it now stores the bounds of the model
* changed readSMD to retrieve the bounds of a model in a smd file
* added the virtual function to SGModel called readBounds that retrieve
the bounds in a smd file
* added readBounds to TopoModel that stores the retrieved bounds and
use them when there is no RealModel

version 0.8
-----------
* functionality added to augment models without seams on periodic faces
  this involves making a copy of the topology (TopoModel) and calling
  TopoModel::augmentPeriodicFaces
* derived classes must make the following changes:
  - GEdge::reparamOnFace replaces GFace::parFromEdgePar
  - GFace::surfPeriodic added
* GFace::periodic now should return true only if the actual face (rather
  than the surface underlying the face) is periodic. The meaning of this
  before was a little unclear.
* now uses util/0.2

version 0.7
-----------
- following functions now const:
  GEntity::{continuous,degenerate,periodic,geomType}
  
- SGModel and GEntity are now both derived classes of SModelMember
  Attributes can be attached to both model entities and the model itself
- SGModel::type() renamed to SGModel::modeler()

version 0.6
-----------
- GEntity::type() and GEN_type() now return appropriate values for uses

version 0.5
-----------
- GE_point and GF_point now return a value to indicate the validity of the
  point (1 = valid, 0 = invalid)
- model now stores local copy of topology
- attributes are attached directly to GEntity objects
- new C interface operators
- can split edges and faces


version 0.2
-----------
- added operators:
  GEntity::bounds - returns bounding box of entity
- ShapesModel constructor arg changed to from char * to const SString &
